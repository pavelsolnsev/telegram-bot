# Test-Driven Development (TDD) Workflow

**IMPORTANT: Before implementing any new feature or code addition, you MUST follow this workflow:**

1. **Write tests first** - Create or update test files before writing the implementation code
2. **Write minimal code** - Implement only what is necessary to make the tests pass
3. **Refactor if needed** - Improve code quality while keeping tests green

## Core TDD Rules:

- **NEVER** write production code without corresponding tests
- **ALWAYS** write tests before implementing new features
- **ALWAYS** write tests before fixing bugs (write a failing test that reproduces the bug first)
- **ALWAYS** ensure all tests pass before considering a feature complete
- When adding new functionality, create test files in the `__tests__` directory following the existing structure

## When modifying existing code:

- If tests don't exist for the code you're modifying, create them first
- Update existing tests if the behavior changes
- Ensure backward compatibility or document breaking changes

**Remember: Tests are not optional - they are a requirement for any code change.**
