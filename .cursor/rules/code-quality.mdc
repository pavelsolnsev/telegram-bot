## Error Handling:

- Handle errors gracefully with proper try-catch blocks
- Use async/await properly with error handling
- Never leave unhandled promise rejections
- Provide meaningful error messages

## Code Standards:

- All tests must pass before committing
- Maintain test coverage for critical functionality
- Follow existing code patterns and conventions
- Write clean, readable, and maintainable code
