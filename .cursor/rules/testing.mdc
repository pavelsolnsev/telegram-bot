# Testing Standards

## Test Structure:

- Use Jest as the testing framework
- Follow the existing test patterns in `__tests__` directory
- Mock external dependencies (database, Telegram API, etc.)
- Use descriptive test names that explain what is being tested
- Group related tests using `describe` blocks

## Test Coverage Requirements:

Test files should cover:
- Happy path scenarios
- Edge cases
- Error handling
- Boundary conditions

## Test Execution:

- All tests must pass before committing
- Maintain test coverage for critical functionality
- Run `npm test` to execute all tests
- Run `npm run test:watch` for development
- Run `npm run test:coverage` to check coverage
