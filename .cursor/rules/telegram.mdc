# Telegram Bot Development Rules

## General Principles:

Always follow the test-driven development approach. Before writing any code, first describe and provide the tests that verify the required behavior. After that, write the implementation that satisfies those tests. The tests must be complete, clear, and reproducible. Code should only be written after the tests.

## Telegram Bot Specific:

- Mock Telegram API calls in tests (use jest mocks)
- Test bot commands and callbacks separately
- Verify message formatting and keyboard buttons
- Test error handling for Telegram API errors (429, 403, etc.)
- Ensure proper async/await usage for Telegram API calls
